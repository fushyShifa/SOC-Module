# SOC-Module
A collection of sources of documentation, and field best practices, to build and run a SOC (including CSIRT).

Those are my view, based on my own experience as SOC/CSIRT analyst and team manager, as well as well-known papers. Focus is more on SOC than on CERT/CSIRT.

My motto is: without reaction (response), detection is useless.

NB: Generally speaking, SOC here refers to detection activity, and CERT/CSIRT to incident response activity. CERT is a well-known (formerly) US trademark, managed by [CERT-CC](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), but I prefer the term [CSIRT](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-response) as it precisely refers to incident response.

# Fundamental concepts

## Concepts, tools, missions, attack lifecycle, red/blue/purple teams

### MITRE references:
* [11 strategies for a world-class SOC](https://github.com/cyb3rxp/awesome-soc/blob/main/11-strategies-of-a-world-class-cybersecurity-operations-center.pdf), Strategy 5: Prioritize Incident Response, pages 101-123,
> Prepare for handling incidents by defining incident categories, response steps, and escalation
paths, and codifying those into SOPs and playbooks. Determine the priorities of incidents for
the organization and allocate the resources to respond. Execute response with precision and
care toward constituency mission and business.

### Dedicated page
Cf.: [SOC/CSIRT Basic and fundamental concepts](https://github.com/cyb3rxp/awesome-soc/blob/main/soc_basics.md).

## SOC core

### MITRE references:

* [11 strategies for a world-class SOC](https://github.com/cyb3rxp/awesome-soc/blob/main/11-strategies-of-a-world-class-cybersecurity-operations-center.pdf), Strategy 8: Leverage Tools to Support Analyst Workflow, pages 101-123,
> Consolidate and harmonize views into tools and data and integrate them to maximize SOC
workflow. Consider how the many SOC tools, including SIEM, UEBA, SOAR, and others fit
in with the organization’s technical landscape, to include cloud and OT environments

### From logs to alerts: global generic workflow

Quoted from [this article](https://www.managedsentinel.com/siem-traditional-vs-cloud/):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16035152/206025151-759a0040-365e-4145-aa88-f7a7b737f8be.png)

Following the arrows, we go from log data sources to data management layer, to then data enrichment layer (where detection happens), to end-up in behavior analytics or at user interaction layer (alerts, threat hunting...). All of that being enabled and supported by automation.


### SOC architecture of detection
Based on [CYRAIL's paper drawing](https://slideplayer.com/slide/15779727/), that I've slightly modified, here is an example of architecture of detection (SIEM, SIRP, TIP interconnections) and workflow:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16035152/207597681-22c9da6d-d430-4660-b807-3e86138a0d9c.png)

* Sensors log sources are likely to be: audit logs, security sensors (antimalware, FW, NIDS, proxies, EDR, NDR, CASB, identity threat detection, honeypot...).



# Mission-critical means (tools/sensors)

## MITRE references
* [11 strategies for a world-class SOC](https://github.com/cyb3rxp/awesome-soc/blob/main/11-strategies-of-a-world-class-cybersecurity-operations-center.pdf), Strategy 7: Select and Collect the Right Data, pages 101-123,
> Choose data by considering relative value of different data types such as sensor and log data
collected by network and host systems, cloud resources, applications, and sensors. Consider
the trade-offs of too little data and therefore not having the relevant information available and
too much data such that tools and analysts become overwhelmed.

# IT achitecture of a SOC

## Have a single and centralized platform ('single console')

As per [NCSC website](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/building-a-security-operations-centre/detection/detection-practices#section_2):
> Indications of an attack will rarely be isolated events on a single system component or system. So, where possible, having a single platform where analysts have the ability to see and query log data from all of your onboarded systems is invaluable.
> Having access to the log data from multiple (or all) components, will enable analysts to look for evidence of attack across an estate and create detection use-cases that utilise a multitude of sources.
> By creating temporal (actions over a period of time) and spatial (actions across the estate) use-cases, an organisation is better prepared to address cyber security attacks that occur system wide.



## Disconnect (as much as possible) SOC from monitored environment

The goal is to prevent an attacker from achieving lateral movement from a compromised monitored zone, to the SOC/CSIRT work zone.

### Enclave: 
* Implement SOC enclave (with network isolation), as per MITRE paper drawing:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16035152/186420265-4c0275b2-d70e-4fec-936c-712c1c4802a8.png)

* only log collectors and WEF should be authorized to send data to the SOC/CSIRT enclave. Whenever possible, the SOC tools pull the data from the monitored environment, and not the contrary;

* on top of a SOC enclave, implement at least a [level 2 of network segmentation](https://github.com/sergiomarotco/Network-segmentation-cheat-sheet#level-2-of-network-segmentation-adoption-of-basic-security-practices);

SOC’s assets should be part of a separate [restricted AD forest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/forest-design-models ), to allow AD isolation with the rest of the monitored AD domains. 


### Endpoints hardening:

* SOC/CSIRT's endpoints should be hardened with relevant guidelines;
   * My recommendations: [CIS benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/), [Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319)

* Mobile network security (2G/3G):
  * My recommendation: Dust Mobile.


## Harden SOC/CSIRT environment
* Implement hardening measures on SOC workstations, servers, and IT services that are used (if possible).
   * e.g.: [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/), [Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319)
* Put the SOC assets in a separate AD forest, as [forest is the AD security boundary](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/gathering-information-about-your-active-directory-deployment), for isolation purposes, in case of a global enterprise's IT compromise
* Create/provide a disaster recovery plan for the SOC assets and resources.
* Implement admin bastions and silo to administrate the SOC env (equipments, servers, endpoints):
  * My advice: consider the SOC environment as to be administrated by **Tier 1**, if possible with a dedicated admin bastion. Here is a generic drawing from Wavestone's article (see Must read references): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16035152/202517740-812091b6-ff31-49cd-941e-3f6e4b4d140c.png)
  * Recommended technology choices: [Wallix PAM](https://www.wallix.com/privileged-access-management/)
  * Implement a [level 3 of network segmentation](https://github.com/sergiomarotco/Network-segmentation-cheat-sheet#level-3-of-network-segmentation-high-adoption-of-security-practices)
  * You may want to use throwable machines (virtual machines) for incident response or specific artefacts analysis. Here are my recommendations:
    * [Microsoft Developer virtual machines](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/);
    * Hardening [script](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/Windows-Optimize-Harden-Debloat);
    * If needed, [Flare-VM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm) framework to automate tools installation;
